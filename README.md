# File Uploader

This is a file uploader site where users can upload files that are then stored in a database. The front end is created using React and Vite, and the back end is built with Express.js.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes npm)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/praveen4898/File_uploader.git
    
    ```

2. **Install dependencies for both front end and back end:**

    ```bash
    # Install front end dependencies
    cd frontend
    npm install
    
    # Install back end dependencies
    cd ../backend
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Application

1. **Start the front end development server:**

    Navigate to the `frontend` directory and run:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    This will start the Vite development server for the front end. The application should now be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) (or another port if 3000 is in use).

2. **Start the back end server:**

    Navigate to the `server` directory and run:

    ```bash
    npm run start
    ```

    This will start the Express server. The server should now be running at [http://localhost:4500](http://localhost:4500) (or another port if 5000 is in use).

### Project Structure

- `frontend/`: Contains the React front end code.
- `backend/`: Contains the Express back end code.


### Usage

1. Open your browser and go to the front end URL: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
2. Use the interface to upload files. The uploaded files will be stored in the database.
